# Rust Learning Docs

> Public VitePress documentation site published to GitHub Pages. Part of the
> learning-docs hub.

> **Read [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) first** — it summarizes what has been
> added over time (tiers, CI changes) so you have context before reading the code.

## Content model
- Content lives in `src/`. Tiers: `introduction`, `beginner`, `intermediate`.
- Each tier is a numbered ladder building ONE concrete artifact.
- Tier `index.md` frontmatter: `title`, `tier`, `platform: rust`.

## Add a page
1. Create `src/<tier>/NN-title.md` with a goal, steps with complete code, and a
   runnable checkpoint (command + expected output).
2. Add it to the tier `index.md` ladder and to the sidebar in
   `.vitepress/config.mts`.

## Add a tier
New `src/<tier>/` + `index.md` (frontmatter) + a sidebar group + a home feature
card in `src/index.md`.

## Build
- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm docs:build`   # must pass; checks dead links
- `pnpm docs:preview`
